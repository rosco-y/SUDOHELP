  <h1 class="Topic">SudoKube Options</h1>
  <p>There are quite a few options in SudoKube.  Most were developed with the goal of simplifying the task of solving a SudoKube puzzle.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To get to the Options, you first press &quot;ESC&quot; (escape) on the keyboard.  This returns you to the initial Welcome Screen:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><img height="333" src="assets/images/Screen captures/Welcome Screen Dialog.jpg" width="216" /></p>
  <p>Then when you click on the large Options Button The Options screen is opened:</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>There are several options:</p>
  <ol class="listItem">
    <li><u>Reveal Errors.</u>  <em>Display errors in Red.</em> When selected, Errors are displayed in Red to indicate that the value is incorrect.  Otherwise incorrect values are presented in black or blue (if the &quot;Blue User Values&quot; option is selected.)</li>
    <li><u>Animate Rotations</u>.  <i>When spinning SudoKube.  </i>When selected, rotations of the SudoKube are slightly more gradual, making it easier to see which way SudoKube was rotated.</li>
    <li><u>Cleanup Candidates.</u>  <em>After solving values.  </em>When a Cell is Solved, all the Candidates with the solution-value effected by the solution are cleared.  These candidates are influenced by the new value.</li>
    <li><u>Click on Values.</u>  Left-Click on a Solution-Value (correct value for a cell.) to clear all the candidates with that value related to the cell with the solution value.  This is a quick way to clear multiple inaccurate candidates.</li>
    <li><u>Right Click Cube Values</u><em> to set Selected Value </em>Right-clicking on any displayed value in the SudoKube (other than candidate-values) selects the Selected Value, so that subsequent clicks on unassigned cells sets the cell&#39;s solution value.</li>
    <li><u>Highlight Selected Value</u> When a value is Selected, then all occurrences in the SudoKube of that value are italicized to make them easier to identify.</li>
    <li><u>Difficulty</u>  How hard do you want the puzzle to be?  There are seven choices ranging from Easiest to Hardest.  SudoKube Puzzles are rated as being more difficult if they have fewer clues (or givens).  The easiest levels are<br />
      elementary counting problems: (i.e, this column/row/box is missing a 8--therefore, the solution to this blank cell has to be an 8.)  Personally, I feel those with a meticulous personality will have few problems solving the Easiest, Easier and Easy levels<br />
      As each layer (puzzle) in the SudoKube can be solved independently.  I personally do not have a meticulous (careful) personality, and find that I make errors even in the easy levels.  I enjoy the personal challenge of trying solve the easier levels with<br />
      as few errors as possible--but I may have a bios toward enjoying this game that I have put so many hours into developing.   Try it and see what you think.<br />
      The harder levels get very challenging (in my opinion) --you need to refer to the other layers and the satisfaction is sometimes in solving a single cell.  Advanced Sudoku Solvers will no doubt have a different perspective, as they employ many <br />
      advanced solving techniques with ease and will need to refer to the layers surrounding a layer a lot less than us solvers with less skill.  If you&#39;re interested in learning some of these techniques, there are many, many excellent resources on the web that<br />
      can be found by searching for &quot;hidden pairs&quot; and &quot;hidden triplets&quot; or &quot;x-wing&quot;.  Searching for those three techniques should lead you quickly down the road to Sudoku Proficiency.<br />
      <br />
      I&#39;m way behind in these advanced techniques, but I believe the harder levels in SudoKube should offer significant challenges even for expert solvers.

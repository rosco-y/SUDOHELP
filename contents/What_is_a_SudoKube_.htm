  <h1 class="Topic">What is SudoKube?</h1>
  <p>A SudoKube is simply 27 Sudoku Puzzles meshed together to form a 9x9x9 Cube made of Sudoku Puzzles.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  <p>27 Sudoku Puzzles, One Layer at a Time.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>At first blush, this might look simply like 27 random Sudoku puzzles pasted into a cube, but care must be taken to observe the traditional <a data-xref="{title}" href="assets/Rules_of_Sudoku.htm">Rules of Sudoku</a> so that 1-9 is maintained in all 3 directions: Back-to-Front, Right-to-left and Top-to-bottom.  That is, each column and row, height, width or depth must contain the values 1-9 inclusive and with no omissions.<u></u></p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="Note"><em>Note: </em>It should be noted that the although Sudoku <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="Cells" href="#">Cells</a> represent a puzzle&#39;s solution, they are not unique to a given Layer, or Puzzle.  Each cell shares itself with 3 puzzles, --the one facing Front, the facing Up, and the one facing Right.  At a glance, it may look like a Cell could contain multiple values, depending on your view of it: FRONT, TOP or RIGHT.  In fact, each cell contains only one solution-value.  As a result, when you solve a value for a Cell, you are actually solving the Cell for 3 puzzles at once.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Also notice that each 3x3 region (the 9 sub-groups) in all of the layers must also contain 1-9 without omissions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><u>How do I solve a blank cube?</u></p>
  <p>Although each of the small cubes in the Layers have 6 sides that can be viewed, each cube only has one solution value.  This value is either revealed as a clue when the puzzle is first started, or hidden.  The object of Sudoku is to deduce the hidden values such that the numbers 1-9 appear once in each row, column and 3x3 subgrid with no repeats or omissions.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><u>Placing values on cubes.</u></p>
  <p>Once a hidden value is deduced using simple logic (e.g, &quot;there is already a &#39;4&#39; in this column...therefore this cell cannot be a &#39;4&#39;.) then you must place this value on the cell.  To do this you must select the required value from the Value-Selection column to the right of the SudoKube.</p>

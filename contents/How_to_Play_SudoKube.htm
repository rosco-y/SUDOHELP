  <h1 class="Topic">How to Play SudoKube</h1>
  <p>SudoKube conforms to all of the rules of Sudoku: Each row, Column and 3x3 block must contain the number 1-9 without omissions.  That&#39;s just about it--how can it be easier?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The only difference is that a Sudoku puzzle is defined on a 9x9 grid and a SudoKube puzzle is defined on a 9x9x9 grid, adding a depth element.</p>
  <p>SudoKube is made up of 9 Sudoku Puzzles, each one on a layer front to back.  This makes 27 Layers, or individual puzzles-layers.  That might sound like a lot of Sudoku Puzzles to solve--but when you solve a value for one puzzle, you are actually solving a value for three puzzles.  That&#39;s because each value in SudoKube participates in three interlocked puzzles.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Solving all these layers in SudoKube requires that you be able to see and edit each individual puzzle-layer.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>To solve the puzzles in SudoKube, you must navigate the layers.</p>

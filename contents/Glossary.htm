      <h2 class="GlossaryTerm">Candidate</h2>
      <p>A Candidate is one possible solution for an unsolved cell in a Suduko puzzle.  Until a puzzle is solved there are many situations where a cell may have multiple candidates.  When a value is unknown, a solution might be multiple values (e.g, &quot;this cell may be a 7, 9, 5 or a 6, I just don&#39;t exactly know yet.&quot;)</p>

          <figure class="Note">Note: Notice that the candidate &#39;1&#39; is not a legal value for the cells in the top and bottom rows of the sub-grid, because their ore 1&#39;s to the left in these same rows.  Similarily, the values &#39;2&#39; and &#39;3&#39; in the 3x3 region preclude the possibility of place a 2 or a 3 in any of other cells in this sub-grid.</figure>
